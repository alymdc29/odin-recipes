      Crispy Potato Mojos! Super easy and yummy snack or appetizer for your next
      get-together. Potatoes dipped in fried chicken mix = AMAZING.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 potatoes, washed</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>
        11/2 cups fried chicken breading mix, like Shore Lunch brand or Oven Fry
        brand
      </li>
      <li>Oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cut the unpeeled potatoes into thin slices, about 1/4 inch thick. The
        thinner you cut them, the more crispy (like chips) they will get. I like
        to cut some a little thicker and some thinner.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place 1-2 cups oil (about one inch deep) in a large frying pan. Heat oil
        over medium heat until water sizzles across the top. While oil is
        heating, dip potato slices in milk and coat with the fried chicken
        breading mix.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully drop potatoes into the oil right away (so the batter doesnâ€™t
        get soggy) and fry for 2-3 minutes on each side, adjusting heat as
        necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove and drain on a paper towel lined plate. Serve with ranch,
        ketchup, cheese, or any other kind of sauce.
      </li>
    </ol>
