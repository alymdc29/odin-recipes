    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Mussel pasta is a delectable seafood dish that combines tender mussels
      with al dente pasta in a flavorful sauce. The briny sweetness of the
      mussels pairs perfectly with the savory richness of the sauce, often made
      with garlic, white wine, tomatoes, and fresh herbs. Whether served as a
      simple weeknight dinner or as an elegant entr√©e for special occasions,
      mussel pasta offers a taste of the sea with every bite, delivering both
      comfort and sophistication to the dining table.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups dry white wine</li>
      <li>4 bay leaves</li>
      <li>4 pounds small mussels, scrubbed and debearded</li>
      <li>Pinch of saffron threads</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>4 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
      <li>3/4 pound artisanal Italian spaghetti or linguine</li>
      <li>Kosher salt</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large pot, combine the wine with the bay leaves and bring to a
        boil. Add the mussels, cover, and cook over high heat, shaking the pan a
        few times, until the mussels open, about 5 minutes. Drain the mussels in
        a colander set over a medium bowl. Pour the mussel broth into a glass
        measure. Crumble the saffron into the mussel broth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Discard any unopened mussels. Remove the mussels from their shells and
        place in a bowl. Pour the melted butter over the mussels and toss to
        coat. Cover with plastic wrap.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the extra-virgin olive oil in a large, deep skillet. Add the thinly
        sliced garlic and cook over low heat just until golden brown, about 4
        minutes. Add the crushed red pepper and cook for 1 minute longer. Slowly
        pour in the reserved mussel broth, stopping when you reach the grit at
        the bottom of the glass measure. Add the lemon juice and simmer over
        moderately high heat until the sauce is reduced to approximately 1 cup,
        about 8 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the spaghetti just until
        al dente. Drain the pasta well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the buttered mussels and the hot spaghetti to the mussel sauce and
        toss over low heat until the pasta is uniformly coated. Season with salt
        and pepper. Transfer to warmed shallow bowls and serve at once.
