    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Buffalo wings are a popular American appetizer featuring crispy chicken
      wings tossed in a tangy, spicy Buffalo sauce. Originating in Buffalo, New
      York, these wings are typically served with celery sticks and a side of
      blue cheese or ranch dressing for dipping. Perfect for game days, parties,
      or casual gatherings, Buffalo wings are loved for their bold flavor and
      satisfying crunch.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 lb. chicken wings</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp. vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 tsp. garlic powder</li>
      <li>Kosher salt</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/4 c. hot sauce (such as Frank's)</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp. honey</li>
      <li>4 Tbsp. butter</li>
      <li>Ranch dressing or blue cheese dressing, for serving/li></li>
      <li>Carrot sticks, for serving</li>
      <li>Celery sticks, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 400° and place a wire rack over a baking sheet. In a
        large bowl, toss chicken wings with oil and season with garlic powder,
        salt, and pepper. Transfer to prepared baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake until chicken is golden and skin is crispy, 50 to 60 minutes,
        flipping the wings halfway through.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small saucepan, whisk together hot sauce and honey. Bring to simmer
        then stir in butter. Cook until butter is melted and slightly reduced,
        about 2 minutes. Heat broiler on low. Transfer baked wings to a bowl and
        toss with buffalo sauce until completely coated. Return wings to rack
        and broil—watching carefully!—until sauce caramelizes, 3 minutes. Serve
        with ranch dressing and vegetables.
