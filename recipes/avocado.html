    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Avocado (be sure that your avocado is soft and ripe)</li>
      <li>Vegan sweetened condensed milk</li>
      <li>Non-dairy milk</li>
      <li>Ice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Halve the avocado and carefully remove the pit. Dice the avocado flesh
        (we do this still in the skin) and transfer it to a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in 1-2 tbsp of vegan condensed milk (we like it on the sweeter
        side, so add it to taste if you are making this for the first time) and
        a splash of non-dairy milk, and mix until uniform.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lastly, add ice to the avocado mixture and mix until uniform and the ice
        begins to melt. This will water things down to make it easier to eat and
        get it nice and chilled.
      </li>
    </ol>
